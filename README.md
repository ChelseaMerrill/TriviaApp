# Trivia App
This is project is a trivia app intended to recreate Trivial Pursuit in a single player format. 

Players will be timed to see how quickly they can correctly answer a question for each category.

Questions will initially come from a hard coded array and the end goal will to be Lambda in python for serverless storage of questions.
